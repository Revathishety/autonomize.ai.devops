Secure Python Web Server Docker Project
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a secure Python web server inside a Docker container. The server uses self-signed SSL certificates to enable HTTPS communication on port 4443. The server runs as a non-root user for enhanced security.

Components
1. Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is the blueprint for building the Docker image. It includes instructions to install necessary dependencies, set up a non-root user, generate SSL certificates, and run the Python web server.

Base Image: The Dockerfile starts with a lightweight Python image (python:3.11-slim).
Dependencies: It installs openssl to generate SSL certificates.
User Setup: A non-root user named nonroot is created for running the server, enhancing security.
SSL Certificates: The generate_cert.sh script is executed to generate the key.pem and cert.pem files.
Port Exposure: Port 4443 is exposed for HTTPS traffic.
Command: The container runs server.py to start the server when it's launched.

2. server.py
This is the Python script that runs the web server.

Functionality: It sets up a simple HTTP server that listens on port 4443 and responds with "Hello, secure world!" to all GET requests.
SSL Integration: The server is secured using SSL by wrapping the server's socket with ssl.wrap_socket, which uses the key.pem (private key) and cert.pem (certificate) files.
Serving HTTPS: The server runs on https://0.0.0.0:4443, ensuring all communications are encrypted.

3. generate_cert.sh
This is a shell script responsible for generating the SSL certificates required to secure the server.

Private Key (key.pem): Generated using openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA.
Certificate (cert.pem): A self-signed certificate is created using openssl req -new -x509, which is valid for 365 days.
Customization: The certificate subject (/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=OrgUnit/CN=localhost) can be customized to reflect  environment or organization.

4. .dockerignore
This optional file specifies files and directories to be ignored when building the Docker image.

Purpose: To prevent unnecessary files (e.g., local cache, Git metadata, or previously generated certificates) from being included in the Docker image.
Entries: Includes common patterns like __pycache__, *.pyc, .git, and *.pem to enhance the build process and security.
Building and Running the Docker Container
To build and run the Docker container, follow these steps:

Build the Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t secure-python-server .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 4443:4443 secure-python-server
Access the Server:

Open a web browser or use a tool like curl to navigate to https://localhost:4443.
Since the server uses a self-signed certificate, you may need to bypass security warnings in your browser.
Security Considerations
Running as Non-root: The server is run by a non-root user (nonroot) to minimize security risks associated with running as root.
Self-signed Certificates: These are suitable for development and testing environments. For production, consider using certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
Certificate Generation: The key.pem (private key) should be securely handled and not exposed. It is not included in the repository and is generated dynamically within the Docker container.
Troubleshooting
Bypassing Browser Warnings: If you encounter a security warning in your browser, it’s because the certificate is self-signed. You can bypass this warning to proceed.
Port Conflicts: Ensure that port 4443 is not in use by another application before running the container.
SSL Certificate Issues: If the certificates are not generated properly, verify the generate_cert.sh script for errors and ensure OpenSSL is correctly installed.

Conclusion
This project provides a secure Python web server setup within a Docker container. It demonstrates key Docker principles, secure server configurations, and SSL/TLS basics. It’s suitable for learning purposes and as a foundation for more complex secure server deployments.
